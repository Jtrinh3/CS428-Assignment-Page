## Rurouni Kenshin

This is a review of project 1 for the group that did AR for the manga, *Rurouni Kenshin*.

There are many things I like and dislike about this project, one of which being the front cover. I like the layout of the front cover since it feels like it is not too clustered, especially with a high number of objects from three-person group as seen in figure 1. I do feel that the voice should be localized to the figure, or at the very least it should stop when the book is flipped over.


With the number of lamps, I feel that it was a missed opportunity to make the scene taking place at night or sunset. The primary reason is because with the current lighting, it feels too intense and that it washes out a lot of the textures as seen in figure 2.

As for the backside, I have issues where the AR button is registering as being constantly pressed, especially when first opening it similarly to the presentation. The video usually auto plays as well upon reveal of the back cover. I would be using a different location for the button as I feel it might have to do with the small text being reflected or blurred by the quality of the viewing device.

I do like that the video can be viewed from both sides and that the layout is like a theater around the book. If the book cover were to be designed for AR viewing, then I feel that the video issue would be solved. Overall, I feel this is a great work on the project.
