At first glance, I really like that simplicity of the layout of the front cover as seen in top left image. It’s not too cluttered nor is it overwhelming. The models used and the lighting blends very well together as well on top of the book’s color. The only improvement I can really see is localizing the sounds and fixing that bird but other than that, it seems well done!

The back cover (seen in the top right and bottom images) is also quite clean and simple, and it puts a smile to my face when I see George swinging on the balloons. First thing I’d recommend for improvement, however, is putting a background on the text; perhaps a slightly transparent one to make it easier to read. This also goes for the title & author on the front cover as well.

Another nice thing I’ve noticed is that the buttons are also quite responsive compared to a few others I’ve tried too, both front and back! Auto-play on the video, however, is a no-go for me, but considering it’s just one video, I’d let it slide in terms of considering this for consumer use. Keeping George hanging around on the back also keep the back not looking too mundane.

Overall, I think the individual did an amazing job and most of the improvement I recommend is primarily me being nitpicky. I feel that this rendition is well made to the point that it won’t be too drastically difference for if it were to hit the shelf.
