# Homework 7
For this homework, I tried out an app called Houzz from the Google Play Store. What the app does is that by using augmented reality, it allows the user to see what a furniture might look like within their home. Although the app offers plenty of furniture to pick from, not all of them offers augmented reality. On paper, this seems like a great idea but there are limitations with our current tech.

Going forward into the future, I imagine corporations and businesses would need a way to quickly scan furniture to create a 3d model, similarly to a flatbed scanner creating a 2D paper.

Another issue which is evident in the pictures above, is that the lighting isn’t properly applied to the 3D models. This is an issue as lighting can drastically affect the appearance of a furniture in the room, especially lighting. I imagine that in the future, there’d be some way to detect the room lighting or adjust it to properly apply to the furniture. Perhaps, if technology permits, we will end up having holograms which can take up lightings from the environment they are shown in.

A future use which I imagine for utilizing this type of AR application is for construction projects to give people a sense of room layout, especially for if room designers are to be sitting in their offices while the physical laborer would be moving furniture and using the AR to know where to put certain furnishing. This would also require a more precise location tracker though as well as dimension. The Houzz app did tell the dimension, but it wasn’t quite accurate. The indoor picture, for example, displayed a shorten cabinet.

Overall, I feel this type of AR would be use for prototyping designs and layouts when the measurement and lighting becomes more accurate.
